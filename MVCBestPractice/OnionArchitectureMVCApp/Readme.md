The Onion Architecture term was coined by Jeffrey Palermo in 2008. 
This architecture provides a better way to build applications for better testability, maintainability,
and dependability on the infrastructures like databases and services.
This architecture's main aim is to address the challenges faced with 3-tier architecture or n-tier architecture 
and to provide a solution for common problems,
like coupling and separation of concerns. T
here are two types of coupling - tight coupling and loose coupling.
