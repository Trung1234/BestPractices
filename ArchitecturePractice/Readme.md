### The Importance of Knowing Patterns

This post is more dedicated to beginners who do not yet understand what is the point of learning and using patterns.

Initially, I also didnâ€™t understand what was the point of using some kind of design pattern in the code - after all, you can just write everything as you want ðŸ¤ª

And then it turned out that there was a lot of repeating code, just an unrealistically large number of dependencies - and the whole trash was that when changes were made, something else broke ðŸ˜µ

 But to solve this whole problem, to distribute the code into classes, interfaces and make normal inheritance - that's exactly what design patterns exist for.

Patterns are already ready-made solutions to the problem and depend on what kind of task we are facing.

So if you are a beginner - and you want to make your code clean, understandable, structured - I recommend that you study design patterns ðŸ¤˜
